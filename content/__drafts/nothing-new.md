There's a few reasons for me to NOT to write a blog.

### I HATE writing ###

Well, at least, I used to.

Throughout school, I was regularly required to complete creative writing assignments, as you likely were as well. I found this to be pretty terrible. I had *nothing* I to say and my attempts were always frustratingly awkward. I would start by typing out everything I could possibly have to say about whatever the assigned topic was -- which was likely something I had no interest in. This first effort often went smoothly, with words and ideas coming to me naturally and with ease. But, this trickle of expression would soon dry up. I would assess my work and it would inevitably fall far short of the minimum required page count, typically two. At best, I'd have half a page. At no point had I been deluded about the hell I would go through to get this damned thing done. But, now I stood at the gates and everything beyond them **really sucked bad**. Anxiety would set in as I saw painful hours expand out in front of me. The effort to come was unimaginable.

The following hours were rapid iterations between two activities. One was like writing -- possibly adding an actual new sentence, but more often inserting filler words or phrases like "very", "however" or "that being said" into existing ones. The other was artificial document expansion -- subtle tweaks to margins, font sizes and line spacing that would squeeze my words into filling more space than they otherwise would. Eventually, the dreadful deed was done. Or, pretty close at least.

Even now, writing these paragraphs was a little uncomfortable.

Writing now in my post-academic life is now very different that it was then. It has purpose, and that makes all the difference for me. Once I got out into the *real world*, where engaging in useless activities is mostly voluntary, I found legitimate reasons to write. I wasn't writing book reports or short stories. I was conducting business correspondence -- emails! I needed to be able to communicate effectively to coworkers, customers and vendors with written words. I cared about doing this well. In the process, I came to deeply appreciate the art of selecting the right word or phrase and of being succinct, yet clear. I rediscovered a love of language that had always been there.

Exploring that is a reason to do this.

### Who are these people? ###

Audience is anonymous and not accessible for immediate feedback

When I email someone as part of my job, there is a clear purpose and context. When I am speaking with someone, I can get a sense of who they are and adjust accordingly. I receive feedback in real-time in facial expressions and body language. I can have some amount of confidence that our exchange is of mutual interest and benefit.

None of that is available in this medium. The audience is anonymous and inaccessible at this moment. Who *are* you? What are you doing here? What am I doing here?

When I fail to write a something that is of interest to anyone, there may be no feedback besides silence. There's no warning that I'm veering off course and no opportunity to adjust my delivery. By the time this goes live, I've already crashed and burned. Flames. Death. Irrelevance. It's just a matter of time until I find out. I guess it's not quite that grim, but that's how it feels as I put down these words.

I'd like to get over that. Another reason to do this.


### Not a good writer ### 


### Nothing new ###

Through the web, humanity has birthed a massive and relentless machine that churns out content at an unimaginable rate. It's breadth and depth of coverage is comprehensive. And there are many, many contributors that are much more skilled writers than I will ever be. Short of the mundane details that are very specific to my life, what could I possibly add to this?

This might be the issue that I struggle with the most. What is the point when every idea has been expressed, every insight documented and with no room left for improvement? Thankfully, I described this problem with my amazing and wise coworker, Shaun McAvinney told me something that really helped me:

"That's ok. People like reading the same thing over and over, but from different perspectives."

I realized he was right. More that a few times in my life, I have had to read multiple different explanations of a concept before it really clicked. That one explanation that finally made it click for me, wasn't necessarily the "best" explanation. It may not have been significant for anyone else. But, it was what I needed to read at that moment for me to get past my mind block. I don't think I'm alone in having this experience.

I was liberated.

I'm not going to worry about documenting a series amazing, novel ideas and insights. Or writing the best description of some concept or process. Or telling the best stories. Instead, I'm going to set a very approachable goal for myself. I'm going to try to write a post that helps one person understand one thing a little better. Or entertains one person. Or makes one person think, "I'm glad I read that."

I can start there.
