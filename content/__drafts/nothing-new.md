### The Early Years ###

Throughout school, I was regularly required to do creative writing, as you likely were as well. This was cruel torture. I had nothing I wanted to say and my attempts were always frustratingly awkward. I was semi-goal-oriented student and the consistently mediocre grades I received on writing assignments began to feel like an inescapable fate. By the end of highschool, I had given up all hope. I looked forward to a post-scholastic life, where I imagined there was no mandate to engage in the painful and pointless activity of creative writing.

### Writing and Writers ###

A couple years into college, something strange happened -- I began to romanticize the life of the writer. I still did not enjoy writing, but I began to imagine a life for myself where I wrote, or *more importantly*, a life where I had something to write about. Authors like Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac or Hunter S. Thompson seemed to have lives full of adventure, in all sorts of settings with a fascinating and endless cast of characters. College began to feel a massive tease. I was shown **......** only to have it taken away after four years. As the real world of responsibility, white collars and cubes loomed large before me, I was looking for a way out. This desperation for an alternative life did not change the reality that, for me, writing was only a source of frustration. A blank piece of paper could be exciting, but after three sentences I was hopelessly lost. I couldn't find words because I had nothing to say. Where was the paperback-worthy excitement in my life. Motivation to write came in an unexpected way.
