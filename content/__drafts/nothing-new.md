### The Early Years ###

Throughout school, I was regularly required to do creative writing, as you likely were as well. This was cruel torture. I had nothing I wanted to say and my attempts were always frustratingly awkward. I was semi-goal-oriented student and the consistently mediocre grades I received on writing assignments began to feel like an inescapable fate. By the end of highschool, I had given up all hope. I looked forward to a post-scholastic life, where I imagined there was no mandate to engage in the painful and pointless activity of creative writing.

### Writing and Writers ###

A couple years into college, something strange happened -- I began to romanticize the life of the writer. I still did not enjoy writing, but I began to imagine a life for myself where I wrote, or *more importantly*, a life where I had something to write about. Authors like Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac or Hunter S. Thompson seemed to have lives full of adventure, in all sorts of settings with a fascinating and endless cast of characters. College began to feel a massive tease. I was shown **......** only to have it taken away after four years. As the real world of responsibility, white collars and cubes loomed large before me, I was looking for a way out. This desperation for an alternative life did not change the reality that, for me, writing was only a source of frustration. A blank piece of paper could be exciting, but after three sentences I was hopelessly lost. I couldn't find words because I had nothing to say. Where was the paperback-worthy excitement in my life. Motivation to write came in an unexpected way.

But Shaun said: That's ok. People like reading the same thing over and over, but from different perspectives.

I realized he was right. I liked that. Other people seemed to as well. I was librerated.

More that a few times in my life, I have to read multiple different explanations of a concept before it really clicked. That one explanation that finally made it click for me, wasn't necessarily the "best" explanation. It may not have made anything click for anyone else. But, it was what I needed to read at that moment for me to get past my mind block. 

I'm not going to worry about documenting a series amazing, novel ideas and insights. Or writing the best desciption of some concept or process. Instead, I'm going to set a very approachable goal for myself. I'm going to try to write a post that helps one person understand one thing a little better. Or entertains one person. Or makes one person think, "I'm glad I read that."
